# Keyboard LED Control

simple python script that sends a command to my Keychron V6 to turn the backlight on and off.

i use it with task schedular so it turns them off when the computer is locked and on when it is unlocked.

it relies on my [custom firmware](https://github.com/TomW1605/qmk_firmware)

no idea what keyboard_test_2.py is for but it is not related to the LED control (i dont think)
